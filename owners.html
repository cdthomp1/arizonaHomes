			<h3>Our Technology</h3>
			<p>Our goal is to provide you with the best service and manage your properties efficiently and effectively.
				Our team has invested in a complete and modern software solution, <a href="https://www.appfolio.com/"
					target="_blank">AppFolio Property Manager</a>. We are excited to share several of the new
				capabilities and how they will benefit you.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>More effectively market your properties and fill vacancies sooner.</strong> AppFolio allows
					us to quickly advertise vacancies online, posting to our website, and hundreds of other listing
					sites. Applicants can also apply right from their smartphones.</li>
				<li><strong>Price rentals right for your market and reduce vacancies.</strong> AppFolio’s built-in
					rental comparison tool provides actual rental rates for units similar to yours in the same
					geographic location. This insight allows us to maximize your revenue and fill vacancies faster.</li>
				<li><strong>Screen for the best residents.</strong> Streamlined, built in resident screening includes
					standard background and credit checks along with past rent payment history. Screens can be completed
					in minutes – enabling us to place the highest quality residents quickly.</li>
				<li><strong>You will be paid faster and more securely.</strong> New functionality provides our team the
					ability to deposit funds directly into your bank account. No more waiting for a check in the mail.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Collect rent faster with online payment options.</strong> Modern residents expect easy,
					online payment options. AppFolio gives residents three convenient ways to pay electronically (Cash,
					E-check, or with a credit card).</li>
				<li><strong>On-demand access to your statements.</strong> Owner statements are securely posted to an
					online Owners Portal, saving time and paper. These simple statements provide you with a quick
					snapshot of your property details for the past month. We can also include maintenance invoices and
					additional reports you request.</li>
				<li><strong>Handle property maintenance issues faster.</strong> We use AppFolio for electronic
					work-orders and communication with vendors so we can quickly resolve issues. At your request, we can
					email you a copy of the work order and relevant information giving you real-time updates.</li>
